## Introduction 

- This project is a derivative of [Simple-Button](https://github.com/Kim-J-Smith/Simple-Button), aiming to provide an open-source C language button framework for the CH32 series microcontrollers (Nanjing Qinheng). 

- The project is triggered by EXTI interrupts for button presses, offering functions such as "short press, long press, timed long press, double click, counted multiple clicks, combination button, long press retention", and it is well-suited for "low power consumption". 

- This project is easy to use and simple to operate, and the documentation and comments are detailed.
